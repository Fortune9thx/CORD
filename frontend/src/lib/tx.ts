/**
 * Transaction outcome classification.
 *
 * The single place the app decides whether a write succeeded. Three rules hold
 * everywhere, and each exists because the opposite has caused a real failure:
 *
 *  1. Success is an **allow-list**. A missing or unrecognized field is failure,
 *     never success. A deny-list ("anything but FINISHED_WITH_ERROR") lets an
 *     undefined result through as a pass.
 *  2. Reaching a terminal status is not the same as succeeding. CANCELED and
 *     the timeouts are terminal and are failures.
 *  3. Consensus is checked separately from execution. A write can execute
 *     cleanly and still persist nothing when validators disagree.
